# Earthquake_migration_imaging

This repository provides the codes used in 'A Shallow Reflector Beneath Krafla Volcano, NE Iceland, Detected With Seismic Migration of Local Earthquake Phases' by Regina Maass, Ka Lok Li, Christopher J. Bean, Benjamin Schwarz and Ivan Lokmer (to be submitted to JGR Solid Earth).


## Name
Earthquake migration imaging

## Description

The RVSP (reverse vertical seismic profiling) method - more commonly used in controlled-source seismology - was here adapted for imaging with earthquakes. The code is demonstrated using local earthquake data from Krafla volcano, NE Iceland.
