# Earthquake_migration_imaging

This repository provides the Python codes used in 'A Shallow Reflector Beneath Krafla Volcano, NE Iceland, Detected With Seismic Migration of Local Earthquake Phases' by Regina Maass, Ka Lok Li, Christopher J. Bean, Benjamin Schwarz and Ivan Lokmer (to be submitted to JGR Solid Earth). 

CODES: Includes the codes for the workflow: 
- 1_binning.py: Binning (gridding) of the study area
- 2_processing.py: Processing of data and stacking in CIP (common-image-point) gathers
- 3_plotting.py: Data visualization (plotting)

META: Contains files needed in to reproduce results from the paper
- station information
- earthquake information
- pre-calculated traveltimes for direct P- and S waves for each earthquake-station combination

## Description

The RVSP (reverse vertical seismic profiling) method - more commonly used in controlled-source seismology - was here adapted for imaging with earthquakes. The code is demonstrated using local earthquake data from Krafla volcano, NE Iceland.
